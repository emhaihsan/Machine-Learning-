# How You Can Define Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for certain tasks.

We can imagine Machine Learning as a process where a computer is given a lot of data and programmed to find patterns within the data. After seeing the patterns, the computer can make a prediction or decision based on new data, even without human intervention.

For example, we want a computer to identify spam emails. With machine learning, we can give a lot of spam and non-spam emails. Then, the computer will learn how to extract patterns to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. After ‘learning,’ the computer can check new emails and decide whether they are spam or not based on the patterns it has learned before.

There are three main types of Machine Learning:

**Supervised Learning** - Model trained with labeled data, ex, House price prediction based on historical price and house features.

**Unsupervised Learning** - Model trained with unlabelled data. For example, customers can be grouped into several segments based on purchasing behavior.

**Reinforcement Learning** - Model learning is based on feedback from the action that is executed and is often used for specific goals. Ex: Agent learns to play a game to maximize score.

Machine learning allows the system to learn based on experience and make better predictions.
