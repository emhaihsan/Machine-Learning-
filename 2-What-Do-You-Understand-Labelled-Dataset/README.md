# What do you understand Labelled training dataset?

That is a set of data already labeled or annotated for every data point on it. It means that every input has a known output. Labeling is the correct answer for every example on the dataset. In machine learning, this kind of data is used for model training to recognize patterns and then resulting correct predictions.

Labeled Datasets play a crucial role in supervised learning. Model using the label to:

- Compare the prediction with the correct label to get the loss/error.
- Use that error to correct the prediction through optimization methods such as gradient descent.
